title: Manga's Visual Language
---
Attempting to differentiate Japanese comics (manga) and American comics by simply looking at the artwork is not very helpful because art styles range from ‘realistic’ to ‘cartoony’ in both spheres. So how do we create a distinction? Well, we can look at other aspects of the medium. Many authors associate the ‘comics’ or ‘manga’ medium with that of language. They are not drawing; they are telling a story, ‘comics’ or ‘manga’ being merely another language. And this visual language has symbols and structure. It naturally follows that these two distinct cultures would also develop separate visual languages, just like their verbal and written equivalents. Today, we’ll briefly look at a few features of the Japanese visual language; I’ll save the detailed analysis for another time.

<blockquote> 
    <p>“I don’t consider them pictures… In reality I’m not drawing. I’m writing a story with a unique type of symbol.”</p>
    <p>-Osamu Tezuka  on manga, cited by Frederik L. Schodt, in Manga! Manga!: The World Of Japanese Comics (Kodansha USA, 1983)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Symbols</h3>
A symbol is a conventional representation of an object, function or process that can carry an abstract meaning along with its literal one. They help express inner emotions and other character states because unlike prose, the reader does not have inside information and is an external observer. Some popular symbols that exist in manga are: 

<ul>
    <li>Abstract background patterns :</li>
    <p>The backgrounds of the pages may abruptly change to match the emotions of the character or the scene, fire for rage, flowers to signify a budding relationship, rain for sadness, fog or mist to show confusion.</p>
    <li> Expressive dialogue bubbles:</li>
    <p>The speech/thought bubbles change to reflect the tone of the dialogue. Dotted borders for whispers, explosion shaped bubble for anger, a non-uniform bubble shape for nervousness.</p>
    <p>Characters in manga often have large eyes, small noses, tiny mouths, and flat faces. This visual style can be attributed to Disney cartoons from the US inspiring Osamu Tezuka and other mangaka, it is now a popular fixture in the medium.</p>
    <li>Eyes</li>
    <p>The eyes of characters are reshaped or are changed to indicate emotions, ‘X’s being used to indicate death or unconsciousness, a heart shape to signal infatuation, larger eyes to show innocence or purity, narrower and sharper eyes signal cunning or evil intentions.<p>
    <li>Head and face</li>
    <p>The head and face of a manga character is often the most expressive feature, cross popping veins to show anger or irritation, blushes to show embarrassment, a nosebleed for sexual excitement, snot bubbles to indicate a state of sleep or boredom.</p>

    </div>
    <li>Onomatopoeia</li>
    <p>Onomatopoeia are words that are similar to the sounds they refer to; words like ‘biff’, ‘boom’, ‘bam’,  ‘whoosh’ are popular examples. Comics are visual mediums similar to films and onomatopoeia help augment the emotion and intensity of a situation by conveying sounds and emphasising actions. Without them, comic frames would lose a layer of expression. 
    Japanese has a massive number of onomatopoeia and there are several categories. The first two represent real sounds that you can hear but the last 3 categories are idiophones, which are words that evoke an idea in sound. Like the way someone feels, a mental state, or an action.With onomatopoeia, the normal textbook mizu wo nomimasu – “I drank water” becomes mizu wo gabu gabu nomimashita – “I guzzled water.Japanese feelings and true meaning are uniquely expressed through these sound effects.</p>
</ul>



<h3>Structure</h3>
The problem first time readers of manga will often face is the reading direction; manga is read right to left unlike the normal western convention of left to right. This reading direction owes its origins to the Japanese script which is formally written in a format called ‘Tategaki’, in this format the characters are written in columns from top to bottom ordered from right to left. The panels in manga follow the same convention and eventually, the entire book.

</div>
When manga was first translated to English and introduced to the West, the publishers would flip the pages because it was believed that the original right to left format would dissuade prospective customers. This resulted in the reading direction changing to the more familiar left to right. It is fair to assume that any creator would want his/her work to be enjoyed in a format that was as close to the original as possible and this flipping would not go down well with most of them. On top of this the Western reader experienced a few oddities. The majority of characters became left handed, people were driving on the wrong side of the road, words flipped on t-shirts and billboards and orientation issues like a character pointing to the left referencing the right in dialogue. In the later years as manga became more popular, publishers would eventually leave the original reading direction untouched and concentrate on translating the manga while attempting to preserve its original meaning.

<h3>Panelling</h3>
A panel is an individual frame or a single drawing in the multiple sequence of a comic book. Put enough of these panels together in the right order and you get a story.  It is a simple solution to a difficult problem in art, how do you visually represent time? Comic authors use it to depict the flow of the story. The simplest panelling example is a series of panels that are all of equal size, but different authors have different requirements and they modify this base design as and when necessary. Courtesy of Tezuka Osamu’s cinematic styles in the 1950’s and from what I have observed, manga is generally more experimental in its panelling than western comics. Here are a few examples
<ul>
    <li>Quick Shots</li>
    <p>Similar to the film technique of using multiple quick shots in succession to convey chaos or urgency, manga authors also make use of the same concept. A series of smaller, less detailed panels ensure that the reader moves at a much quicker pace. </p>
    <li>Long takes</li>
    <p>Larger, more spacious panels are used for shots of great importance (although some authors overindulge). They set or wrap up a scene and give the reader some breathing room. </p>
    <li>Unusual Orientation</li>
    <p>The shapes of the panels can subconsciously convey meaning to the reader. Strange panel shapes or orientation signal that ‘something is off’, a series of panels surrounding a central character show him/her as the subject of interest. </p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
Manga on the surface looks similar to western comics (minus the colour).This is deceptive however, as the deeper you go the more differences you will encounter. But it is not necessary to research all of Japanese culture and literature to begin to appreciate manga. Even regular western readers that are well versed in the visual language and actively make connections between the panels, speech and symbols will stumble at a few instances and miss their meaning. However don’t let that stop you from enjoying the genius storytelling, deep characters, intriguing themes and varied genres that this medium offers.
