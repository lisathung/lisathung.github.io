title: Manga's Visual Language

Attempting to differentiate Japanese comics (manga) and American comics by simply looking at the artwork is not very helpful because art styles range from ‘realistic’ to ‘cartoony’ in both spheres. So how do we create a distinction? Well, we can look at other aspects of the medium. Many authors associate the ‘comics’ or ‘manga’ medium with that of language. They are not drawing; they are telling a story, ‘comics’ or ‘manga’ being merely another language. And this visual language has symbols and structure. It naturally follows that these two distinct cultures would also develop separate visual languages, just like their verbal and written languages. Today, we’ll briefly look at a few features of the Japanese visual language; I’ll save the detailed analysis for another time.
